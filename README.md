## Pytorch-minModel
This is the repository that holds my implementation for SOTA deep learning models. 

Note that this is mainly for educational purposes, so it only contains the minimum code for each model. As can be expected, the hyperparameters are not super optimized and the datasets used are the most accessible(smallest) ones.

## Quick start
To set up the right environment, run the following
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Optional) If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can accelerate training by installing [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads/) and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) of the correct version.
